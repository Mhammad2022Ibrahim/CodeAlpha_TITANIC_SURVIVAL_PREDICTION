# CodeAlpha_TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION
# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the Titanic dataset and uses machine learning to predict passenger survival.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in `titanic.csv`, which includes the following features:

- `survival`: Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
- `class`: Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
- `name`: Name
- `sex`: Sex
- `age`: Age
- `sibsp`: Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
- `parch`: Number of Parents/Children Aboard
- `ticket`: Ticket Number
- `fare`: Passenger Fare
- `cabin`: Cabin
- `embarked`: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

## Usage

To run the notebook, you need to have Jupyter installed. You can install it via Anaconda or pip. Once installed, you can start Jupyter by running `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` in your terminal, and then navigate to the notebook file (`Code_Alpha_Titanic_Prediction.ipynb`).

Alternatively, you can open the notebook in `Google Colab`. Just upload the notebook file to your `Google Drive` and open it with `Google Colab`.

## Models

The notebook includes the following models:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost)
- Neural Networks
  
Each model is trained and evaluated using `accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score`.
